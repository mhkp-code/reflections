How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    

	It shows only differences so less code needs wto be analyzed



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    

	It allows to do safe experimentation



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    

	Pro is that i can commit ony when i want to, cons is that I might forget to commit in crutial moment


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    

	it depends on the purpose of the tool whether they going to be used with files related to each other or separate files.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    

	git log shows the history of all commits while git diff allows to compare two different commits


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?



	Because all of the time I am able to go back to version that worked correctely and then compare it to non working version which will allow me to find the cause of the problem    



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    

I don't want to use it at all, but I am affraid it will be necessary during my programming lessons
